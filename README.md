# java-engine : Operational Transform in Java

This repository contains information related to operational transform, and an implementation of some OT masters and replicas.

Operational Transform is a process that consists in transforming operations based on their order of arrival, in order to create a replicated log available to all clients and with eventual consistency guarantees. It is used in collaborative tools like Google Drive. More information can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation).

This software is developed as a semester project (PRO) at HEIG-VD, academic year 2019-2020.
